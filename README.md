# Ideaforge_waterfall-methodology– Project Showcase

This repository showcases a project where I applied the **Waterfall Model** to an AI-powered platform that helps users refine unclear ideas, analyze feasibility, and generate tasks, mind maps, or project plans.

---

## Project Overview

The platform allows users to:

- Input unclear or unstructured ideas (text or voice)
- Let AI analyze, clarify, and restructure these ideas
- Receive actionable suggestions, tasks, and visual diagrams
- Access advanced premium features like collaboration rooms and diagram customization
- Integrate social login (LinkedIn/Google) and payment systems (Stripe/PayPal)
- Export content as PDF, images, or shareable links

## Waterfall Model Stages Applied

### 1️⃣ Requirements Definition
- Collected **functional** & **non-functional requirements**
- Defined the core system capabilities and constraints

### 2️⃣ System & Software Design
- Created **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** to visualize data flow between components (using Eraser)
- Built **ERD** to define database entities and relationships (using draw.io)
- Designed **UI Wireframes** to represent user interface and interaction flow (using Figma)

### 3️⃣ Implementation & Unit Testing
- Developed a **prototype** to demonstrate system layout and user interactions
- Used **Visily** to design and present the user experience

### 4️⃣ Integration & System Testing
- Prepared a **Test Plan** with multiple **Test Cases** covering:
  - Core functionalities
  - AI features
  - Collaboration and visualization options
- Verified system integration and feature completeness

### 5️⃣ Deployment & Maintenance Planning
- Defined deployment approach on a **secure, scalable cloud infrastructure**
- Planned integration with payment gateways and OAuth for social login
- Outlined maintenance, monitoring, and backup strategies
