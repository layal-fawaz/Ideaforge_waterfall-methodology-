        <h1>Project Overview – IdeaForge</h1>
    </div>

    <p>IdeaForge is an AI-powered platform where users can input unclear or unstructured ideas. The AI helps clarify and refine these ideas, suggests ways to develop them, and transforms them into structured formats such as visual mind maps, actionable tasks, or project plans. Users can collaborate, customize their workspace, and export their ideas.</p>

    <p>In this project, I followed the <span class="bold">Waterfall model</span>, where each stage was completed in sequence before moving on to the next, ensuring a clear and structured development process.</p>

    <h2>2. System and Software Design:</h2>
    
    <div class="arrow">Requirements → Design</div>
    
    <p>After gathering and documenting all system requirements, I moved to the design stage. At this point, the requirements acted as the foundation, guiding how the system architecture and components should be structured.</p>

    <h3>Data Flow Diagram: <span class="italic">created using Eraser</span></h3>
    <p>First, I drew the Data Flow Diagram to illustrate the main processes, data stores, external entities, and data flows within the system.</p>

    <h3>ERD: <span class="italic">created using draw.io</span></h3>
    <p>I created the Entity-Relationship Diagram to define the database structure, including entities, attributes, and relationships, ensuring proper storage and organization of user data, ideas, tasks,...</p>

    <h3>Wire Frame: <span class="italic">designed using Figma</span></h3>
    <p>Finally, I designed the UI wireframes to visually represent the user interface, focusing on screens for login, idea submission, AI-generated outputs, task management, and premium features.</p>

    <h2>3. Implementation and Unit Testing:</h2>
    
    <div class="arrow">Design → Implementation</div>
    
    <p>Once the design was completed and approved, I moved to implementation. The detailed design provided a prototype, making it easier to translate the system plan into an actual working program.</p>

    <h3>Prototype: <span class="italic">created using Visily, To View full prototype on visily click here</span></h3>

    <h2>4. Integration and System Testing:</h2>
    
    <div class="arrow">Implementation → Testing</div>
    
    <p>After building the system, I transitioned to testing. This stage ensured that the implemented features matched the requirements and design specifications.</p>
    
    <p>Test plan was prepared and executed, covering some test cases to ensured that all modules worked correctly as a whole system.</p>

    <h3>Test Plan:</h3>
    
    <h4>Objective:</h4>
    <p>Ensure that the platform correctly transforms unclear ideas into structured outputs (feasibility analysis, mind maps, tasks, project plans) and that all core features work properly.</p>

    <h4>Scope:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Login (LinkedIn/Google)</li>
        <li>Idea submission (text/voice)</li>
        <li>AI processing & output generation</li>
        <li>Premium features (mind maps, collaboration, dashboard customization)</li>
        <li>Payments (Stripe)</li>
        <li>Export & sharing</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Approach:</h4>
    <p>Manual testing with 5 test cases covering main system feature</p>

    <h4>Resources & Tools</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Tools:</span> Google Docs/Excel for documentation, Figma prototype for mock testing.</li>
